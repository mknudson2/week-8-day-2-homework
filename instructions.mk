Designing a Flexible OOP System for RPG Game Characters

In this project, we aim to create a flexible Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) system to represent characters in an RPG game. The game will feature four unique characters, each with different attacking and defending mechanisms. Let's outline the characters and their attributes:

1. Orges:
   - Attacks with a club
   - Defends with a shield

2. Peons:
   - Attacks with a club
   - Defends with a shield

3. Knights:
   - Attacks with a sword
   - Defends with armor

4. Archer:
   - Attacks with a bow and arrow
   - Defends with a tunic

All characters can collect gold, and this feature remains the same for every new type of character.

Our main objectives are:
- Enable each character to attack, defend, and collect gold.
- Provide flexibility for characters to change their fighting style if needed.

To achieve this, we will implement multiple classes and interfaces, including an abstract class. The OOP system will allow seamless interaction between characters and their respective attributes.

By designing this flexible OOP system, we ensure that each character in the RPG game has distinct characteristics and can dynamically adjust their fighting mechanisms. This enhances engagement and clarity for players, providing an immersive gaming experience.
